## Lesson 3: Go is fast and simple

Go code generally runs faster than interpreted languages and compiles faster than other compiled languages like C and Rust.

## Lesson 4: Comparing Go's speed

Go is _generally_ faster and more lightweight than interpreted or VM-powered languages like:

- Python
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Ruby
- Java

However, in terms of execution speed, Go does lag behind some other compiled languages like:

- C
- C++
- Java

Go is a bit slower mostly due to its automated memory management, also known as "Go runtime". Slightly slower speed is the price we pay for memory safety and simple syntax!
